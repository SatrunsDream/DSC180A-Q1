1. What are the 3 characteristics used to compare if NSI and local structure data match? 

Location, presence of a basement, number of floors

2. How much of the NSI data matches fully matches the local data? How much matches with 2 key characteristics? 

Only 36% of the residential structures fully match the local data. 47% of the structures match on location and basement presence.

3. What can cause discrepancy in mean structure value? 

NSI assigns similar structure values to all building type: as seen in Table 2, the values range $230K-$240K, while the Philly values range $184K-$247K.

4. Are discrepancies in financial losses higher for NSI-Local structure data when there is a location mismatch or when there is a property mismatch (and a location match)?  

Location mismatches cause higher discrepancies.

5. Look at lines 279-292 – what are the implications for assessing building data quality and model performance? 

First implication I can think of is the fact that this paragraph talks about using means and how it may not be effective when the data has a lot of variability.
Secondly, there is a problem when it comes to data quality assessment in the sense that we take the local data as “accurate,” and there may be errors in that data that we did not account for.

6. Describe the methodologies used to correct the NSI data. What are advantages and disadvantages of this? Recall our discussion on parcels etc. at the beginning of the class. 

Refinements described in the paper: tract-level proportions of basement and number of stories, tract-level median value for all structures, updating NSI records based on location matches to Philadelphia parcels.
Adv.: these are pretty uncomplicated fixed that can help a lot; using data that already exists (e.g. parcel data)
Disadv.: this approach leaves out the data NSI was missing

7. What are the policy implications of having the spatial distribution of flood risk wrong? 
Having the spatial distribution of flood risk wrong may lead to poorer communities that need more assistance in case of a flood to not get the needed support.
